My name is Andrea Sabatini. My family has been working since 1956 in the field of extracting of inert materials, production of the inert from conglomerates, both semantic and bituminous. In the course of the working activities, we have had many satisfactions. Then, in the last decade, we have identified new activities. On one hand, there is the environmental sensibility that clearly has increased in the last years. And on the other hand, it could be an activity at the end of the original one of our family, in the key of the green economy. Due to this, in 2015 we had a plan installed for the recovery of some types of waste, mainly from the mechanized sweeping of streets and of the sands coming from purifiers and bonified lands. This process in a quite evident way determines, as you can see in the white upper part, the inert materials coming from traditional extractive activities. In the lower grey part there are the inert materials coming from waste recovery. This allows us to maintain the raw materials for future generations and shows that careful recovery of waste can offer again reusable raw materials in the life cycle. I'm favorably amazed and impressed by how interesting this sector can be. It has allowed us to work in Umbria, in the Marche region, in the Abruzzo region, in the Lazio region. I believe that this is both for Italy and Europe in general a driving activity that will relaunch the economy of the countries and keep us up with sustainability and with the green commitment that in the future will represent our engagement and work. Thanks and best regards and see you soon.
